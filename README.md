# NeuralProphet
A Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [AR-Net](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net), built on PyTorch.

For a visual introduction to NeuralProphet, view the presentation given at the [40th International Symposium on Forecasting](notes/Presented_at_International_Symposium_on_Forecasting.pdf).

## Documentation
We are working on a [documentation page](https://ourownstory.github.io/neural_prophet/). Contributions welcome!

## Use 

### Requirements

NeuralProphet requires Python version >= 3.7

### Install
You can now install neuralprophet directly with pip:
```shell
pip install neuralprophet
```
If you plan to use the package in a Jupyter notebook, we recommended to install the 'live' version:
```shell
pip install neuralprophet[live]
```
This will allow you to enable `plot_live_loss` in the `fit` function to get a live plot of train (and validation) loss.

If you would like the most up to date version, you can instead install direclty from github:
```shell
git clone <copied link from github>
cd neural_prophet
pip install .
```
### Basic example
```python
from neuralprophet import NeuralProphet
```
After importing the package, you can use NeuralProphet in your code:
```python
m = NeuralProphet()
metrics = m.fit(df, freq="D")
future = m.make_future_dataframe(df, periods=30)
forecast = m.predict(future)
```
You can visualize your results with the inbuilt plotting functions:
```python
fig_forecast = m.plot(forecast)
fig_components = m.plot_components(forecast)
fig_model = m.plot_parameters()
```


## Model Features
* Autocorrelation modelling through AR-Net
* Piecewise linear trend
* Fourier term Seasonality at different periods such as yearly, daily, weekly, hourly.
* Lagged regressors
* Future regressors
* Holidays & special events
* Sparsity of coefficients through regularization
* Plotting for forecast components, model coefficients as well as final forecasts

## Contribute
### Dev Install
Before starting it's a good idea to first create and activate a new virtual environment:
```python
python3 -m venv <path-to-new-env>
source <path-to-new-env>/bin/activate
```
Now you can install neuralprophet:

```python
git clone <copied link from github>
cd neural_prophet
pip install -e .[dev]
neuralprophet_dev_setup
```
Notes: 
* The last command runs the dev-setup script which installs appropriate git hooks for Black (pre-commit) and Unittests (pre-push).
* Including the optional `-e` flag will install neuralprophet in "editable" mode, meaning that instead of copying the files into your virtual environment, a symlink will be created to the files where they are.


### Style
We deploy Black, the uncompromising code formatter, so there is no need to worry about style. Beyond that, where reasonable, for example for docstrings, we follow the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

As for Git practices, please follow the steps described at [Swiss Cheese](https://github.com/ourownstory/swiss-cheese/blob/master/git_best_practices.md) for how to git-rebase-squash when working on a forked repo.

## Changelogs
### Coming up Next
For details, please view the [Development Timeline](notes/development_timeline.md).

The next versions of NeuralProphet are expected to cover a set of new exciting features:

* Robustify training for different datasets
* Logistic growth for trend component.
* Uncertainty estimation of individual forecast components as well as the final forecasts. 
* Support for panel data by building global forecasting models.
* Incorporate time series featurization for improved forecast accuracy.

### 0.2.7 (next release)
* soft-start regularization
* confidence interval for forecast (as quantiles via pinball loss)

### 0.2.6 (current release)
* Auto-set batch_size and epochs
* random-seed util
* continued removal of AttrDict
* fix to index issue in make_future_dataframe

### 0.2.5
* documentation pages added
* 1cycle policy
* learning rate range test
* tutorial notebooks: trend, events
* fixes to plotting, changepoints
