    "Both the Prophet and the NeuralProphet model share the concept of decomposing a time series into it's components which allows a human to inspect and interprete the individual components of the forecast. Since NeuralProphet adds new functionality, its interface may differ in part. We provide a guide on migrating a Prophet application to NeuralProphet. In the following we will provide code snippets for the most common functionalities when migrating from Prophet."

    "- **Conditional seasonality**  \n",
    "  Conditional seasonality allows to model certain events as seasonal effects (eg. whether it's currently NFL season). This can be archieved in Prophet by passing the argument `condition_name` to `add_seasonality(...)`. This feature is currently also not supported in NeuralProphet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional features of TorchProphet\n",
    "- **Autoregression**  \n",
    "  TorchProphet allows to model autoregression of arbitrary lag lengths by building on a Neural Network implementation of the autoregression algorithm (called AR-Net). More information can be found here [Autoregression](https://neuralprophet.com/html/autoregression_yosemite_temps.html).\n",
    "- **Lagged regressors**  \n",
    "  TorchProphet does not only support \"future\" regressors like in Prophet, but also lagged regressors that are simultaneous to the time series to predict. More information can be found here [Lagged covariates](https://neuralprophet.com/html/lagged_covariates_energy_ercot.html).\n",
    "- **Global model**  \n",
    "  TorchProphet supports hierachical forecasts by training a global model on many simultaneous time series that is used to improve the performance of predicting an individual time series. More infos can be found here [Global Model](https://neuralprophet.com/html/global_modeling.html).\n",
    "- **Neural Network architecture**  \n",
    "  TorchProphet models the forecast components using a Neural Network. By default, the network has no hidden layers. However, for more complex time series, the depth of the network can be increased to learn more complex relations.\n",
    "- **PyTorch**  \n",
    "  TorchProphet is build on Pytorch (soon PyTorch Lightning) and thus provides interfaces for developers to extend the vanilla model for specific use cases."
