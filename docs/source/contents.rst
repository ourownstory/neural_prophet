=========================================
NeuralProphet
=========================================

Fusing traditional time series algorithms using standard deep learning methods, built on PyTorch, inspired by `Facebook Prophet <https://github.com/facebook/prophet>`_ and `AR-Net <https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net>`_.

- `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet>`_

Features
------------------

NeuralProphet provides many time series modeling and workflow features, in a simple package:

- Support for global modeling of many time series.
- Automatic selection of training related hyperparameters.
- Plotting utilities for forecast components, model coefficients and final predictions.
- Local context through Autoregression and lagged covariates.
- Changing trends and smooth seasonality at different periods.
- Modeling of event, holiday, and future regressor effects.
- Many customization options, such as regularization.

Simple Example
------------------

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from neuralprophet import NeuralProphet
    >>> m = NeuralProphet()
    >>> metrics = m.fit(df)
    >>> forecast = m.predict(df)
    >>> m.plot(forecast)
