# What has Changed from Prophet

NeuralProphet has a number of added features with respect to original Prophet.
They are as follows.

* Gradient Descent for optimisation via using PyTorch as the backend.
* Modelling Auto-Regression of time series using AR-Net
* Modelling lagged regressors using a separate linear or Feed-Forward Neural Network.
* Directly predict specific forecast horizons.
* Train a single model on many related time-series (global modelling).

Due to the modularity of the code and the extensibility supported by PyTorch,
any component trainable by gradient descent can be added as a module
to NeuralProphet. Using PyTorch as the backend, makes the modelling process
much faster compared to original Prophet which uses Stan as the backend.
